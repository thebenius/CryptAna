# CryptAna

CryptAna is a tool to support crypto analysis and penetration testing on known or unknown crypto systems.

## Bugs
CryptAna is a tool designed to support a hacker. It is neither designed to be unbreakable nor always 100% accurate. It is the users duty to interprete the output.

## ToDo
 - unify interfaces
 - structure code
 - document code
 - document code well
 - write good readme
 - write examples
